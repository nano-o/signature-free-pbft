In this repository we are developing a formalization of a signature-free version of PBFT.

Currently, [PBFT.thy](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nano-o/signature-free-pbft/main/browser_info/Unsorted/PBFT/PBFT.html) contains a very high-level specification of some aspects of the protocol. It was developed in a few hours with the help of Claude code using [the Isabelle/Q MCP server](https://github.com/awslabs/AutoCorrode/tree/main/iq).
